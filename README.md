# Project Summary: Wine Quality Prediction üçá
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using various machine learning classification models. The analysis involves data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation to determine the most effective approach for classifying wine quality.

1. Data Loading and Initial Analysis üìä
The project began by loading the wine quality dataset. An initial inspection was performed to understand its structure and content:

Dataset Overview: The first few rows of the dataset were displayed to get a glimpse of the features, which primarily include various chemical properties of wine (e.g., fixed acidity, volatile acidity, pH, alcohol) and a quality rating.

Data Information: df.info() provided a concise summary, confirming the number of entries and columns, and verifying data types. All columns were found to be numerical (float64 or int64), which is convenient for direct model input.

Missing Values: A check for missing values (df.isnull().sum()) confirmed that the dataset was clean, with no missing entries, eliminating the need for imputation.

Irrelevant Column Removal: The 'Id' column was dropped as it serves merely as an identifier and holds no predictive power for wine quality.

2. Data Visualization üìà
Visualizations were crucial for understanding the distribution of the target variable and the relationships between features:

Quality Distribution: A count plot of the quality ratings revealed the distribution of wine quality in the dataset. This helps to identify if the dataset is balanced across different quality levels. - Correlation Matrix: A heatmap of the correlation matrix for all physicochemical properties was generated. This visualization is vital for understanding how different chemical components relate to each other and to the quality of the wine. Strong correlations can indicate important features or potential multicollinearity. - Feature-Quality Relationship: Box plots were used to visualize the relationship between key chemical properties (e.g., fixed acidity, density) and quality ratings. These plots help to identify trends and differences in chemical compositions across various quality levels, providing insights into which properties might be stronger predictors.

3. Model Building and Evaluation ü§ñ
The core of the project involved building and evaluating several classification models to predict wine quality:

Feature and Target Definition: The dataset was split into features (X), which are the chemical properties, and the target variable (y), which is the quality rating.

Train-Test Split: The data was divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to ensure the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data.

Model Training and Prediction: Three different classification models were trained and used to make predictions on the test set:

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method known for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier: A linear classifier that uses stochastic gradient descent for training, suitable for large-scale datasets.

Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A powerful and versatile model capable of performing linear or non-linear classification.

Model Evaluation: Each model's performance was assessed using standard classification metrics:

Accuracy Score: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.

Classification Report: Provides a detailed breakdown of precision, recall, and f1-score for each quality class, offering a comprehensive view of model performance, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.

The Random Forest Classifier generally showed the best performance among the tested models, indicating its suitability for this wine quality prediction task.
